					<p>The 1 week of vacation passed by way to quick. Now after doing alot of nothing I shall finally go back to school. (I could use a second week but that is not how it works)<br>
					Now me and Lars will start working on project Maloz, which I by the way finally managed to set up in my NAS properly. At first the sync option wasn't working correctly but I fixed that so it should be fine now.<br>
					I didn't have any sleep today to try to fix my completely broken sleeping schedule. (it works for me, I don't sleep one day then the next day I go to bed early and wake up early.)<br>

					<p>We started working with linux-server today, where we installed linux OpenSUSE in virtualbox. OpenSUSE is in my opinion a really good looking and nicely working linux distrubution. I only used linux mint before so i have to adjust a little bit. I do honestly really like the fact that it doesn't force me to do updates. The reason I like that is because Windows does force updates (when theres an important update) even in the middle of your work. Which is insanly annoying. Anyhow, linux server is fun so far.<br>

					<p>Started working on Databases. I finished chapter one yesterday and I'm working on chapter 2 right now, it seems quite interesting to be honest. Even though chapter 2 is a really long chapter compared to chapter 1. It's still really interesting and I like working on it.<br>
